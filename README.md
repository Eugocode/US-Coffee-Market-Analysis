# Analysis of US Coffee Market üçµ

by: Dleamnor Euraze Cawaling

## About this Project

This project aims to provide an exploratory report offering a data-driven strategy for a group of investors breaking into the US coffee market. They seek to leverage insights from "The Great American Coffee Taste Test" to assist in launching their first coffee shop.

Specifically, they aim to answer the following questions:

1. **Target audience:** What type of customer should we target, and what are their preferences?
2. **Product offering:** What types of coffee beans and drinks should we offer?
3. **Pricing strategy:** How can we align prices with customer value perception?

## About the Dataset

The data used for this analysis came from _"The Great Amercan Coffee Taste Test",_ conducted by YouTube coffee expert James Hoffmann and Cometter. Approximately 4,000 American responded to the survey.

## Methodology

_Tools used: PowerBI and Figma_

After gathering the requirements and acquiring the dataset, I checked for data quality issues by examining data types, missing values, duplicates, etc. Given the presence of numerous nulls in the dataset, I opted not to drop or impute null values as they could significantly impact the results. Instead, I focused on gaining insights from the available data.

Next, I performed feature selection by identifying relevant variables for analysis based on each objective. I then conducted data aggregation by creating essential measures to display the necessary data.

To identify the target customers, I selected respondents who go to cafes to drink coffee. From this subset, I analyzed their demographics (Gender, Age, Educational Background, Employment Status, Ethnicity/Race, Working Set-up).

For product offering recommendations, I conducted exploratory data analysis on variables such as "Favorite Coffee Drink," "Additives," "Coffee Strength," "Coffee Flavor," "Roast Level," and "Amount of Caffeine." Based on this analysis, I ranked each category to identify top favorites.

To assist with the pricing strategy, I determined the average monthly spending on coffee and the maximum price tolerance per cup.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

**Target Customers:** Based on the data analysis, the typical demographic profile of individuals who typically drink coffee at a cafe includes males aged 25-34, employed full-time, of Caucasian ethnicity, working from home, and holding a bachelor's degree.

**Product Offering:**
Offer a variety of coffee drinks with an emphasis on Pour Over and Latte, as these are the most favored options. Also, ensure to include options for black coffee, as over half of respondents prefer their coffee without additives and wants them to be full caffeine. However, offer a selection of milk, dairy alternatives, and coffee creamer for those who prefer to customize their drinks.

In addition to that offer fruity flavor as this is the preferred flavor among respondents. Consider featuring different fruity blends or flavored syrups to enhance the taste experience. Moreover, consider offering a range of other flavor options to cater to different taste preferences, such as chocolatey, full bodied, bright and nutty as these are next to the rank.

Also, don't forget to ensure that significant portion of the coffee offerings align with their roast level preference which is light or medium.

**Pricing Strategy:** Given the average monthly coffee spending of $20-$40 and a maximum price tolerance per cup of $8-$10, I recommend offering standard coffee options within the $8-$10 range to accommodate customers with lower price tolerance. Additionally, introducing premium blends or drinks priced slightly higher, around $10-$15 or more, can appeal to those seeking a unique or higher-quality experience. This strategy maximizes revenue while catering to a broad customer base.
