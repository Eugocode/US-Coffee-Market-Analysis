# Analysis of US Coffee Market

by: Dleamnor Euraze Cawaling

## About this Project

This project aims to provide an exploratory report providing a data-driven strategy for a group of investors breaking into the US coffee market. They would like to leverage insights from "The Great American Coffee Taste Test" to help them in starting their first coffee shop.

Specifically, they wanted to answer the following questions:

1. **Target audience:** What type of customer should we target, and what are their preferences?
2. **Product offering:** What types of coffee beans and drinks should we offer?
3. **Pricing strategy:** How can we align prices with customer value perception?

## About the Dataset

The data used for this analysis came from _"The Great Amercan Coffee Taste Test",_ conducted by YouTube coffee expert James Hoffmann and Cometter. Approximately 4,000 American responded to the survey.

## Methodology

_Tools used: PowerBI and Figma_

After gathering the requirements and acquiring the dataset. I checked for data quality issues by checking the data type, missing values, duplicates, etc.There are a lot of nulls in the dataset, so I decided to not drop or do some imputations on null values as they may greatly affect the result but instead I focus on gaining insights from available data.

Then I did some feature selection, wherein I selected relevant variables for my analysis for each of the objectives. Then, I did some data aggregation by adding some measures that are essential for displaying the necessary data.

To identify the target customers, since this is a coffee shop. I have chosen those respondents who goes to cafe to drink coffee. Based on those respondents who go to cafe, I then checked their demographics.

To help the investors decide on the products to offer, I did exploratory data analysis on different variables such as "Favorite Coffee Drink", "Additives", "Coffee Strength", "Coffee Flavor", "Roast Level" and "Amount of Caffein". From these I ranked each of them and identify the top favorites for each category.

To help them with their pricing strategy, I identified the average monthly spending on coffee, and the maximum coffee price tolerance per cup.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

**Target Customers:** People who typically drinks coffee at a cafe are mostly males, ages 25-34 years old, full-time employee, are White/Caucasians, working from home and have a bachelor's degree.

**Product Offering:** The most favorite coffee drink is Pour Over followed by Latte, for Flavor it is Fruity. More than half of the respondents prefer their coffee black with no additives, this explain why there are 91% who prefers a full caffeine coffee and a coffee strength of somewhat strong. However, most people who like to add additives likes to add milk, dairy alternative, and coffee creamer on their coffee.
For roast level it is light.

**Pricing Strategy:** Considering the average monthly coffee spending of $20-$40 and maximum price tolerance per cup of $8-$10, it's essential to offer a pricing structure that aligns with these parameters while maximizing revenue. My recommendation is to offer standard coffee options within $8-$10 range to accomodate customers with lower price tolerance. Also, introduce premium blends or drinks priced slightly higher, around $10-$15 or more, to appeal to those seeking a unique or higher-quality experience. In this way you can mazimize your revenue, while still accomodating a lot of customers.
